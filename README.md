# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying - Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS. Despite following the correct syntax and build process, some Tailwind classes fail to apply to elements as expected. This could be due to several factors, including unexpected interactions between plugins or conflicting CSS rules.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when applying specific Tailwind CSS classes to HTML elements.  These classes seem valid, but they do not render in the browser.  This is a deviation from expected behavior and doesn't appear related to common mistakes like typos or missing build steps.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the build process for Tailwind CSS (e.g., `npm run build`)
3. Open the HTML file in a browser
4. Observe that some classes are not applied, even though they appear correctly in the source code.

## Potential Causes

* **Plugin Conflicts:** The problem might stem from conflicting styles or behavior between different Tailwind CSS plugins.
* **CSS Specificity:** Other stylesheets or CSS rules might have higher specificity, overriding the Tailwind classes.
* **Build Process Errors:**  Though less likely, a subtle error in the Tailwind build process could be responsible.
* **Uncommon class combinations:** The bug may be specific to certain class combinations.

## Solution

Solutions can vary depending on the root cause. This could involve disabling plugins, carefully inspecting CSS specificity, debugging the build process, simplifying the problematic class combination or updating TailwindCSS to the latest version.
