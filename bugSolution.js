// Solution might involve debugging CSS specificity, identifying plugin conflicts,
// or adjusting the Tailwind build process.  A specific solution will depend on the
// exact cause of the bug.  The following is a placeholder showing potential debugging techniques:

// 1. Check for CSS Specificity Conflicts using browser developer tools
// 2. Simplify classes applied to the elements to isolate the problem
// 3. Temporarily disable plugins to see if any are causing the issue
// 4. Ensure the build process is complete and free of errors
// 5. Update TailwindCSS to the latest version
